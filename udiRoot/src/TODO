* Need to finish adding config validation support to ensure setupRoot isn't
  getting tricked into handing out privilege (i.e. check for safe file
  ownership, write perms etc). Would be nice to have a better way.

* Add sshd configuration to shifter_core/prepareSiteModifications()

* Rely on recent versions of mount understanding autoclear functionality for
  loop device management.  OK in CLE 5.2, may need to add more explicit loop
  device management for other systems.

* Add unittest
